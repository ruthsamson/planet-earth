# `README.md` - Planet Vitals Website

## üåç About the App

A fully responsive MERN application about the planet that categorizes related topics and provides direct links to the most credible websites and databases. Connects to the OpenWeatherAPI using Express as a backend and provides local weather based on city entry.

## ü§î Reflection

This was my capstone project for my Advanced Full Stack Web Development Course. 

I set out build a information hub for those who are interested or studying our planet. With an earth science research background, I have always wanted a site where credible information is provided about the planet's vitals. These 'vitals' include things like current earthquakes, storm reports, fire radars, etc. 

My focus was to make this website visually appealing and easily accessible. Since the target user audience would expand those in the earth science research field, I wanted to add descriptions and images that would make the information provided on this website easily digestable. Also, those who are not experienced in earth science research may not even be aware that websites that provide such information about our planet are available. It is a fun website that people could use to help on research projects, learn something new, and 

What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
What did you set out to build?
Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
What were some unexpected obstacles?
What tools did you use to implement this project?
This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.
Example:
This was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Twitter API based on what they were interested in, such as 'most tagged users'. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-4.0 and redux.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, LoDash, D3, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a webpack.config.js file to more fully understand the build process.
